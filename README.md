## About The Project

* Designed and built the project using several Design Patterns, Data Source Architectural Patterns, and Object Relational Structural Patterns to develop a Movie IMDb Retrieval System using the IMDb Dataset from Kaggle.

* Developed an interactive UI using React that allows users to explore movie details from the dataset. Implemented parameterized queries, enabling users to customize and filter their search for specific movie information. Designed and established a solid Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural framework in Python for the backend infrastructure.

* Optimized both frontend and backend components with FastAPI, enabling advanced searching and filtering of IMDb movie data. Conducted comprehensive unit tests with PyTest and validated APIs using SwaggerUI for robust API functionality. Implementing efficient refactoring techniques to enhance code structure and maintainability.
